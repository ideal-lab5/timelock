# CMakeLists.txt Library Detection Fix Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow was failing with:
```
Could not find timelock-ffi library in ../../timelock-ffi/target/release
```

This was happening because CMake was looking for library files in the wrong directory.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through debugging, we discovered that Rust workspace builds place compiled libraries in:
- **Actual location**: `target/release/deps/` (workspace root)
- **CMake was looking in**: `timelock-ffi/target/release/` (crate-specific directory)

## Solution Implemented
Updated `examples/timelock-ffi/CMakeLists.txt` with correct library paths:

### Before (Incorrect)
```cmake
set(TIMELOCK_FFI_DIR "../../timelock-ffi/target/release")
# Library files:
# - Windows: timelock_ffi.dll.lib
# - macOS: libtimelock_ffi.dylib  
# - Linux: libtimelock_ffi.so
```

### After (Corrected)
```cmake
set(TIMELOCK_FFI_DIR "../../target/release")
# Library files in deps subdirectory:
# - Windows: deps/timelock_ffi.dll.lib
# - macOS: deps/libtimelock_ffi.dylib
# - Linux: deps/libtimelock_ffi.so
```

## Key Changes Made
1. **Updated base directory**: `timelock-ffi/target/release` → `target/release`
2. **Added deps subdirectory**: All library file paths now include `deps/`
3. **Platform-specific corrections**:
   - Windows: `${TIMELOCK_FFI_DIR}/deps/timelock_ffi.dll.lib`
   - macOS: `${TIMELOCK_FFI_DIR}/deps/libtimelock_ffi.dylib`
   - Linux: `${TIMELOCK_FFI_DIR}/deps/libtimelock_ffi.so`

## Verification
- ✅ Local Windows build successful
- ✅ CMake configuration finds library: `Found timelock-ffi library: C:/dev/timelock/target/release/deps/timelock_ffi.dll.lib`
- ✅ Both C and C++ examples build and run correctly
- ✅ All FFI functionality working as expected

## Expected CI/CD Impact
This fix should resolve the GitHub Actions workflow failures on all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) by ensuring CMake can locate the compiled Rust libraries in their actual build output location.

## Commit Details
- **Commit**: `8549fec` - "Fix CMake library detection for cross-platform CI/CD"
- **Files Modified**: `examples/timelock-ffi/CMakeLists.txt`
- **Branch**: `feature/c-ffi-bindings`

This completes the cross-platform CI/CD configuration required for successful automated builds and testing.
